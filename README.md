# Human Resources Study

This study is around an IT Company to perform Data visualization techniques, Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning models to predict Employee Termination.

## About the data

The dataset took from Kaggle revolves around a fictitious company and the core data set contains : **names**, **DOBs**, **age**, **gender**, **marital status**, **date of hire**, **reasons for termination**, **department**, whether they are **active or terminated**, **position title**, **pay rate**, **manager name**, **performance score**, **absences**, **most recent performance review date**, and **employee engagement score**.

Many points of interest can be explored through all these variables. Because grasping relevant information is the key to set up a good management, it is important for companies to study this kind of dataset and sometimes when it's needed, make new decisions.
Thus, to help our company to evolve, a lot of questions can be addressed thanks to data analysis :
- Is the performance score unequal between different areas of the company ?
- Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score ?
- What is the overall diversity profile of the organization ?
- What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization ?
- Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable ?
- Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't ? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this ?
- Which profiles tend to cumulate absences or to have a poor satisfaction working in the company ?
